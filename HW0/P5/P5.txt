1. 255 seconds. Because cashiers can only count 2 bags per second, they need to perform 255 operations, which amount to 255 seonds.

2. Yes. There 8 cashiers. The idea is divide and conquor. Split 256 bags into 8 groups, each of which contains 32 bags. For each group, one can count them in 31 seconds. Then we merge the 8 counted groups and divide them into 4 groups, each of which contains 2 smaller counted groups. It would take 4 cashiers 1 second to finish counting them. Repeat this until we have 1 group in the end. The time it would take is 31 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 seconds.

3. Assuming we have infinite people to count. Each recursion level the number of groups halves. Since 2^8 = 32, it takes 8 seconds.

4. Please take a look at P5.png. Nmax = 3000 in my case.

5. From 3, we have calculated that there are 8 levels in total, and each level takes one second to complete. If communication time is taken into account, there will be one additional second when one level goes to another (e.g., 256 -> 128 takes one second to communicate since people can communicate simultaneously). There are in total 8-1 = 7 merging (communicating) operations. As a result, it takes 8 + 7 = 15 seconds in this case.

6. 
1 bag senario: We distribute 256 cashiers to do this work. Firstly, each casher approaches
